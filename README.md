# Four New Hybrid Root Bracketing Algorithms: Optimization-Based Approaches for Numerical Root Finding üöÄ

## Project Overview
This project presents four novel hybrid root bracketing algorithms that combine the reliability of traditional bracketing methods with the speed of optimization-based techniques. The algorithms are implemented in Python, evaluated on a diverse set of test functions, and analyzed for convergence and computational efficiency. The results are compiled and discussed in an academic LaTeX paper.

## üìÅ Repository Structure
- **Python Scripts**: Each algorithm is implemented in its own script (e.g., `06-Optimized-Bisection-FalsePosition.py`, `07-Optimized-Bisection-FalsePosition-Modified-Secant.py`, etc.).
- **Results Files**: 
  - `Results.db`: SQLite database containing raw results from algorithm runs.
  - `Results.xlsx`, `CPU_Times_Per_Algorithm.xlsx`, `Results_tableII.csv`: Processed results and summary tables.
  - Plots: PNG files visualizing CPU time and performance (e.g., `avg_cpu_time_per_algorithm.png`, `cpu_time_lineplot_per_problem.png`, etc.).
- **Paper**: 
  - `hybrid_root_bracketing_paper.tex`: Main LaTeX source for the research paper.
  - `hybrid_root_bracketing_paper.pdf`: The only PDF tracked in version control (all other LaTeX build files are ignored).
  - `Sample Latex Paper Format file.tex`: Example format for reference.
- **Reference Papers**: PDF files in the `Refrence Papers/` directory (ignored in version control).
- **Analysis Script**: `analyze_results.py` for processing results and generating plots.
- **References**: `refrences.txt` contains a comprehensive list of related works.
- **CI/CD**: `.github/workflows/benchmark.yml` automates benchmarking on push to `main`.

## üßÆ About the Algorithms
This project introduces and compares four new hybrid root bracketing algorithms:

- **Optimized Bisection-False Position (Optimized_BF):**
  - Combines the reliability of bisection with the speed of the false position method.
  - Alternates between bisection and false position steps to quickly reduce the interval containing the root.

- **Optimized Bisection-False Position with Modified Secant (Optimized_BFMS):**
  - Extends Optimized_BF by adding a modified secant step for even faster convergence.
  - Uses a small perturbation to approximate the derivative and refine the root estimate.

- **Optimized Trisection-False Position (Optimized_TF):**
  - Uses trisection (splitting the interval into three) instead of bisection for potentially faster convergence.
  - Integrates the false position method for acceleration.

- **Optimized Trisection-False Position with Modified Secant (Optimized_TFMS):**
  - Combines trisection, false position, and modified secant steps for maximum efficiency.
  - Offers the fastest convergence in most test cases.

All algorithms are designed to guarantee convergence (if the initial interval brackets a root) and are implemented using the SymPy library for high-precision computation.

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run the Algorithms
1. Ensure you have Python 3.11+ and the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install sympy numpy pandas matplotlib seaborn
   ```
2. Run each algorithm script (e.g., `python 06-Optimized-Bisection-FalsePosition.py`). Results will be stored in `Results.db`.
3. To run all algorithms and regenerate results, you can use the provided scripts in sequence or adapt the CI workflow steps.

## üìä Analyzing Results and Generating Plots
- Run `python analyze_results.py` to:
  - Summarize CPU time and iteration statistics
  - Generate plots (saved as PNG files)
  - Output summary tables for inclusion in the paper

## üìÑ Compiling the LaTeX Paper
1. Make sure you have a LaTeX distribution (e.g., TeX Live, MiKTeX).
2. Compile `hybrid_root_bracketing_paper.tex` using your preferred LaTeX editor or:
   ```bash
   pdflatex hybrid_root_bracketing_paper.tex
   bibtex hybrid_root_bracketing_paper
   pdflatex hybrid_root_bracketing_paper.tex
   pdflatex hybrid_root_bracketing_paper.tex
   ```
3. The resulting PDF will include all tables, plots, and references.

## üîí Version Control and .gitignore Policy
- All LaTeX build files (including PDFs) are ignored except for `hybrid_root_bracketing_paper.pdf`, which is tracked for reference.
- Reference papers and sample build artifacts are also ignored to keep the repository clean and focused.
